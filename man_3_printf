.SH FORMAT OF THE FORMAT STRING
.IP
.PP
The format string is a character string, beginning and ending in its initial shift state, if any.  The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not %), which are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments.  Each conversion specification is introduced by the character %, and ends with a conversion specifier.
The overall syntax of a conversion specification is:

%[$][flags][width][.precision][length modifier]conversion

.SH EXAMPLES
- _printf("Hello %s\n", "World"); Output: Hello World
- _prinf("2 + 2 = %d", 4); Output: 2 + 2 = 4
